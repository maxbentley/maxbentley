## hi there!
my name is Max, and this is my github! i am very much a beginner to programming. the biggest (and only) project I've done so far has been a [web scraper in Python](https://github.com/maxbentley/2020-2021-college-hoops-season-no-threes) that I made in early 2021 when I was into college basketball that took every game and found whether or not the winning team would have won had every three-pointer been a two-pointer.
my skills:
- python (basic)
- java (also basic)

## how to reach me
