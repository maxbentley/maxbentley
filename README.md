## projects
the biggest project I've done so far has been a [web scraper in Python](https://github.com/maxbentley/2020-2021-college-hoops-season-no-threes) that I made in early 2021 when I was into college basketball that took every game and found whether or not the winning team would have won had every three-pointer been a two-pointer.

when i was in high school, i took a class in Bayesian statistics that revolved around building models with Python. you can check out the work that I've done for that class [here](https://github.com/maxbentley/datasciencefund). my final project was a convolutional neural network to classify images of starter pokemon.

i'm currently working on learning javascript to try and make things in the future, whether they be in hackathons or elsewhere.
