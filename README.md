## hi there!
my name is Max, and this is my github! i am very much a beginner to programming - i know some Python and a bit of Java but don't really know much outside of that. the biggest (and only) project I've done so far has been a [web scraper](https://github.com/maxbentley/2020-2021-college-hoops-season-no-threes) that I made in early 2021 when I was into college basketball that took every game and found whether or not the winning team would have won had every three-pointer been a two-pointer.
